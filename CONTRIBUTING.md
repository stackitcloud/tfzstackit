3. Run `go build` to make sure everything's setup correctly
4. Make your changes
   > Please follow the [seven rules of greate Git commit messages](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#seven-rules)
   > and make sure to keep your commits clean and atomic.
   > Your PR won't be squashed before merging so the commits should tell a story.
   >
   > Optional: Sign-off on all Git commits by running `git commit -s`.
   > Take a look at the [Gihub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits) for further information.

   > If any linting issues occur please fix them.
   > Using a nolint directive should only be used as a last resort.
6. Open a PR and make sure the CI pipelines succeed.
   > Your PR needs to have a semantic title, which can look like: `type(scope) Short Description`
